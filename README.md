# Midgard RO Client

**A modern Ragnarok Online client built from scratch in Go**

> Educational project demonstrating how modern AI tools can accelerate game development

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a fully functional Ragnarok Online client that connects to Hercules servers, featuring:
- Enhanced graphics using modern OpenGL
- Clean, maintainable Go codebase
- Deep understanding of game development fundamentals

## 🚀 Q1 2025 Goals

## 🎓 Learning Journey

This project is designed as a learning experience. Each phase teaches specific concepts:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- SDL2 window creation and OpenGL context
- Basic rendering pipeline (vertices, shaders, textures)
- Game loop architecture

### Phase 2: Asset Pipeline (Weeks 3-4)
- GRF archive extraction
- Sprite (SPR/ACT) loading and animation
- Map (GAT/GND/RSW) loading

### Phase 3: Networking (Weeks 5-6)
- TCP socket handling in Go
- Hercules packet protocol
- Login/character flow

### Phase 4: Game World (Weeks 7-10)
- 2.5D isometric rendering
- Entity management
- Basic game mechanics

### Phase 5: Polish (Weeks 11-12)
- UI system
- Sound integration
- Performance optimization

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Go 1.22+**: `brew install go`
2. **SDL2**: `brew install sdl2` (macOS) or `apt install libsdl2-dev` (Linux)
3. **RO Assets**: Obtain data.grf from a legitimate RO installation

### Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Faultbox/midgard-ro.git
cd midgard-ro

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run the client
go run ./cmd/client
```
