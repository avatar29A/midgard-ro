# Session Log: 2025-01-09 Part 3

## Summary
Planning session for Month 1 development roadmap.

## Decisions Made

### Development Strategy: Asset Tools First
Chosen approach: Build asset pipeline tools before game engine rendering.

**Rationale:**
- Deep understanding of RO file formats
- Debugging tools for later engine work
- Visible progress with each deliverable

### Month 1 Plan
1. **Week 1:** GRF reader + grftool CLI
2. **Week 2:** SPR/ACT parsers + sprite viewer
3. **Week 3:** GAT/GND parsers + ground rendering
4. **Week 4:** RSW/RSM parsers + map viewer

## Files Created
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap

## Next Steps
- Start implementing GRF reader (`pkg/grf`)
- Create `cmd/grftool` CLI for testing

## Notes
- User has original game resources available for testing
- Focus on GRF version 0x200 (most common)
